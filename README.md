# AdelLecture
This was the workshop lecture by Adel on the basics of creating and using GitHub.

The following is an abstract from a former class project.  It was chosen for its simplicity for uploading an example on GitHub.


ABSTRACT

This article will highlight on the research of using an ABM to model the behavior of a theoretical population and observe the change on the local reservoir due to this change in behavior.  This type of computational modeling is useful for foresight of how a particular decision can affect a community and the environment.  The goal of this project was to see if it is possible to computationally model a population’s change in behavior on water conservation and how this conservation will affect the local water supply.  This article is a stepping stone for a much larger theis project that will be completed at a later date.  The results for this paper were found by creating an ABM using NetLogo using three different scenarios that modeled water demand based on the decisions of a water master and the demand from the population.  Then, the NetLogo results were used as an input into a water resource system analysis problem using the GAMS software which was used to observe the necessary size of a reservoir that would be needed to supply the demand.  The smallest reservoir found with the highest level of water conservation was 4850 units of water.  The obvious outcome for this model was that the lower water demands would result in a smaller reservoir.  The import takeaway was the process of modeling the population’s behavior computationally and observing how this change in behavior affected the environment and the community.
